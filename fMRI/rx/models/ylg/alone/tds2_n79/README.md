For analyses that include puberty (i.e., PDS score), only 77 participants were included because PDS score was missing for 160 and 174.
Subjects 135 and 137 did not have good go outcomes; a separate contrasts script was run for these subjects, including 9 contrasts total (instead of 13 contrasts). The contrasts are con_0006.nii = bad-baseline, con_0007.nii = bad_go-stop, con_0008.nii = bad_stop-go, con_0009.nii = good-bad. Contrasts 1 thru 5 remained the same: con_0001.nii = decisions-baseline, con_0002.nii = go-stop, con_0003.nii = stop-go, con_0004.nii = outcomes-baseline, con_0005.nii = good-baseline.
